       "AIMessage(content=\"**Next.js: A Popular React-Based Framework for Building Server-Rendered and Static Websites**\\n\\nNext.js is an open-source React-based framework for building server-rendered and static websites. It was created by Vercel (formerly Zeit) and is widely used by developers to build fast, scalable, and maintainable web applications.\\n\\n**Key Features of Next.js:**\\n\\n1. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Next.js allows you to render React components on the server, providing a faster and more SEO-friendly experience for users.\\n2. **Static Site Generation (SSG):** Next.js also supports static site generation, which allows you to pre-render pages at build time and serve them as static HTML files.\\n3. **Internationalization (i18n) and Localization (L10n):** Next.js provides built-in support for internationalization and localization, making it easy to create multilingual websites.\\n4. **Image Optimization:** Next.js includes an image optimization feature that automatically compresses and optimizes images for web use.\\n5. **API Routing:** Next.js provides a built-in API routing system that makes it easy to create API endpoints and handle requests.\\n6. **Built-in Support for CSS and Sass:** Next.js includes built-in support for CSS and Sass, making it easy to write and manage styles.\\n7. **Development Server:** Next.js includes a built-in development server that makes it easy to develop and test your application.\\n\\n**Benefits of Using Next.js:**\\n\\n1. **Improved Performance:** Next.js provides a faster and more scalable experience for users, thanks to its server-side rendering and static site generation capabilities.\\n2. **Easy Development:** Next.js includes a range of built-in features and tools that make it easy to develop and test your application.\\n3. **SEO-Friendly:** Next.js provides better SEO support than traditional client-side rendering, thanks to its server-side rendering capabilities.\\n4. **Scalable:** Next.js is designed to scale with your application, making it easy to handle large amounts of traffic and data.\\n\\n**Example Use Case:**\\n\\nSuppose you want to build a blog website that displays a list of articles. With Next.js, you can create a page component that fetches the list of articles from an API endpoint and renders them on the server. The resulting HTML can be served as static HTML files, providing a fast and SEO-friendly experience for users.\\n\\nHere's an example of how you might implement this using Next.js:\\n```jsx\\n// pages/articles.js\\nimport Head from 'next/head';\\nimport Link from 'next/link';\\n\\nfunction Articles() {\\n  const [articles, setArticles] = useState([]);\\n\\n  useEffect(() => {\\n    fetch('/api/articles')\\n      .then(response => response.json())\\n      .then(data => setArticles(data));\\n  }, []);\\n\\n  return (\\n    <div>\\n      <Head>\\n        <title>Articles</title>\\n      </Head>\\n      <h1>Articles</h1>\\n      <ul>\\n        {articles.map(article => (\\n          <li key={article.id}>\\n            <Link href={`/articles/${article.id}`}>\\n              <a>{article.title}</a>\\n            </Link>\\n          </li>\\n        ))}\\n      </ul>\\n    </div>\\n  );\\n}\\n\\nexport default Articles;\\n```\\nThis example demonstrates how Next.js makes it easy to create a server-rendered page that fetches data from an API endpoint and renders it on the server.\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 698, 'prompt_tokens': 40, 'total_tokens': 738, 'completion_time': 0.930666667, 'prompt_time': 0.001908308, 'queue_time': 0.050253632, 'total_time': 0.932574975}, 'model_name': 'llama-3.1-8b-instant', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_8ab2e50475', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run--44e30d26-dbc5-487f-a30d-8ff807b4a488-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 40, 'output_tokens': 698, 'total_tokens': 738})"
